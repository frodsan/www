Hi! My name is Francesco Rodríguez. I'm a software developer living in Oslo. I moved here from Peru (where I'm from) in 2016. I love code, video games, books, my [🐶](http://instagram.com/doradoeltibetano/) and ⚽.

I currently work at [Hyper](https://www.hyper.no) as a Full-Stack Developer making web applications using my favorite stack: Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Redis and Heroku. You can read more about that in my [resume](https://resume.frodsan.com).

On my spare time, I've been playing with Go, Python and Machine Learning.
